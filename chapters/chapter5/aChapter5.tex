\chapter{Outer Controller Design}\label{chap:outerController}
The vessel's functionality, as stated in \autoref{sec:requirements}, requires it to follow a path along which the bathymetric measurements are taken. \fxnote{This path should be followed as precisely as possible in the interest area. Depending on functional requirements}. The approach taken to survey an area of interest is to divide the area into straight line segments. The path is generated by dividing the straight line segments into a number of waypoints.

The generated path is followed by using an enclosure based steering algorithm \cite[pp. 258-265]{TFossen} that uses the waypoints along the path. This algorithm follows the waypoints using straight lines only. The outputs of the outer controller are the reference for the yaw angle and the velocity along the $x_\mathrm{b}$ axis, which are inputs to the state space controller designed in \autoref{chap:control}. \fxnote{Provisional header}

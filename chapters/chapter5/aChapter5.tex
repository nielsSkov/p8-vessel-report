\chapter{Path Following}
The vessel functionality, as stated in \autoref{sec:requirements}, requires it to follow a path along which the bathymetric measurements are taken. \fxnote{This path should be followed as precisely as possible in the interest area.} \fxnote{For doing that (... explain how we generate the path).} The generated path is followed by using an enclosure based steering algorithm \cite[pp. 258-265]{TFossen} that uses waypoints sampled along the path. The outputs for this controller are the reference for the yaw angle and the velocity along the $x_\mathrm{b}$ axis, which are inputs to the state space controller designed in \autoref{chap:control}. \fxnote{Provisional header}

\chapter{Outer Controller Design}\label{chap:outerController}
fThe vessel functionality, as stated in \autoref{sec:requirements}, requires it to follow a path along which the bathymetric measurements are taken. The path is generated from the given area in straight lines as described in \autoref{sec:pathgeneration}.  The generated path is followed by using an enclosure based steering algorithm \cite[pp. 258-265]{TFossen} that uses waypoints sampled along the path. The outputs for this controller are the reference for the yaw angle and the velocity along the $x_\mathrm{b}$ axis, which are inputs to the state space controller designed in \autoref{chap:innercontrol}.

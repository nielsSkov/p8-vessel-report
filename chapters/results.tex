\section{Controller Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
    \item It should be possible to select the area in which the bathymetric measurements are to be performed.
    \item The ASV should be able to autonomously plan and follow a route, such that the entire survey area is mapped.
    \item The controller should be robust to external disturbances.
    \item THU not exceed 30cm with a 95\% confidence interval.
\end{itemize}

\section{Implementation Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The ASV should record and store data locally for extraction at the end of the survey.
    \item It should be possible to give the ASV a command to stop and steer it back to land.
\end{itemize}

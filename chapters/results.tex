\begin{enumerate}
    \item It should be possible to select the area in which the bathymetric measurements are to be performed.
    %\item A path planning algorithm should be able to plan a path within the selected area such that the bathymetric measurements can be performed.
    %\item The ASV should be able to track the path laid out by the path planning algorithm.
    \item The ASV should be able to autonomously plan and follow a route, such that the entire survey area is mapped.
    \item The controller should be robust to external disturbances.
    \item The ASV should record and store data locally for extraction at the end of the survey.
    \item It should be possible to give the ASV a command to stop and steer it back to land.
    \item THU not exceed 30cm with a 95\% confidence interval.

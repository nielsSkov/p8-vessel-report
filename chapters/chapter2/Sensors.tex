\section{Sensors}\label{sec:sensors}
The control system designed in the vessel requires the presence of sensor data that provides information about the vessel's motion. This is handled by an IMU.

The IMU installed in the vessel is formed by a triaxial gyroscope with a digital range scaling between $\pm300^{\circ}$ s$^{-1}$, a triaxial accelerometer with a range of $\pm$18 g and a triaxial magnetometer with a range of $\pm$\num{2.5} G. It also contains a serial peripheral interface (SPI) to obtain the data. \cite{IMUDatasheet}

The data provided by the IMU is used to estimate both the position and the attitude of the vessel.

%\subsection{GPS}
%The vessel has a UP-501 GPS Receiver installed. It operates with a update frequency up to 10 Hz and its trasmits the received position data through a serial communication to the Low Level Interface. \cite{GPS}

%As the UP-501 is a standard GPS receiver, its precision is in the range of meters \fxnote{How to prove this?? Maybe make a test.}. This makes it cumbersome to control the position of the vessel using only GPS data, and thus, the GPS and the IMU data is combined to obtained the position of the vessel.

\section{Low Level Interface} - Arduino Interface to HLI bla bla

The LLI implemented on the vessel runs in a Arduino Mega Development board with the Atmel microcontroller ATMEGA 2560. It is in charge of extracting the sensor data from the IMU and the GPS and send it to the HLI that runs in the computer. This includes managing the serial communication from the sensors to the Arduino Board and from the Arduino Board to the HLI. 

The LLI handles also the actuators as it receives the rotational speed command for the thrusters from the HLI and calculates the appropiate PWM so the ESCs make the motors turn at the desired speed.

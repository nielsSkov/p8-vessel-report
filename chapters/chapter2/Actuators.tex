\section{Actuators}

The actuation system present on the vessel is constituted by the thrusters. These can be divided into two froward-thrusters and two side-thrusters. 

The forward thrusters are the main actuators present on the vessel and they provide a forward force depending on the rotational speed as 
%
\begin{flalign}
	F(n_\mathrm{PWM}) = 0.2567 \cdot n_\mathrm{PWM} -22.83\ .
	\label{eq:forwardSpeedForce}
\end{flalign}
%
They can also rotate in the opposite direction, producing a backwards force that can be calculated as 
%
\begin{flalign}
	F(n_\mathrm{PWM}) = 0.2567 \cdot n_\mathrm{PWM} -22.83\ .
	\label{eq:backwardSpeedForce}
\end{flalign}
%
These equations have been obtained through experimental tests in \fxnote{Source to thesis}.

The side-thrusters move the vessel sideways but their influence in its motion is limited to low speed maneuvers and intended for fine positioning of the system. For this reason, the side-thrusters in the vessel are not utilized in the controller design for the vessel.

The forward thrusters are actuated with brushless motors bla bla \fxnote{write specs and sources}

In order to have the motors turning to the desired rotational speed, electronic speed controllers (ESCs) are used. These ESCs bla bla \fxnote{write specs and sources}

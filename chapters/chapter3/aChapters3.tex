\chapter{System Model} \label{chap:model}
The model of the surface vessel is based in the methods presented in \cite{TFossen}, where the principal effects that affect the behavior of the vessel are taken into account are described in order to generate a model that serves as a basis for control design and simulations.\fxnote{write pages in the source}

\chapter{Introduction}

Brainstorm:

Autonomous surface vessels (ASV), applications\fxnote{sources needed on all this}:\\
- as a survey vessel performing measurements like bathymetry, temperature, flow in streams, Ph, NO2, NO3, ammonia, salt balance, etc.\\
- groundwater inflow in streams by analyzing temperature maps\\
- from all these measurements (and possibly more) it is possible to focus attention on problem areas both in biology and guidance of marine vessels.\\
- one strength of an ASV is that it can map out an entire stream, whereas manual measurements typicaly will be cumbersome and low in mapping resolution due to accessibility of the stream and time constraints/cost.\\
- for marine survey it can be useful as it can enter narrower and more shallow waters than larger manned vessels would be able to.\\
- the military has also been using ASV's for surveillance.

In this project the focus is first and foremost the control design, which will be realized with focus on bathymetric measurements. This will constitute a basis for setting up requirements for precision which will determine important parameters in the control design.

Why are bathymetric measurements generally interesting?\\
- used for efficient and safe guidance of marine vessels \fxnote{http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/bathyuses.html}\\
- used in biological oceanography, as a for instance it can help in deciding which areas to protect for preservation of sea life \fxnote{http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/bathyuses.html}\\
- is also a parameter used when analyzing streams \fxnote{more concrete source needed if this is to be included. The found source was no good, therefore it is not here.}

Specific case-study:
\fxnote{it could be very helpful if at all possible, since this would give concrete constraints for the precision that should be required of the control design.}

\chapter{Introduction}

Autonomous surface vehicles (ASV) has a range of applications such as environmental monitoring \cite[p. 745]{MAHsieh}, meteorological data collection, marine biological research and surveillance \cite[p. 8-10]{FFahimi}.

One use case for a small ASV is shown in \autoref{fig:USVforRescue}. This is a solution for search and rescue missions in floods. It can be dangerous and difficult for rescuers to search in flooded areas. A drone is able to reach otherwise inaccessible places and provides better vision horizons than an ASV would. The drone however has short battery life, which limits the reach and duration of the mission.

Here the ASV provides long battery life and by carrying the drone, until needed for improved overview, extends reach and duration of each mission.\cite{JZhang}

An other application is bathymetric measurements \cite{MBibuli}. These measurements can be used for efficient and safe guidance of marine vessels. It is also interesting when studying biological oceanography where it i.e. can help in deciding which areas to protect for preservation of sea life \cite{NOService}.

In volcanic countries observations are carried out by volcanologists to provide forecasts and warnings. One observation target is crater lakes. Flash floods and hydrovolcanic explosions can be caused by such lakes. Observing these can help providing information when precautions must be taken and potential evacuation planned.\cite{AWatanabe}

The small ASV seen in \autoref{fig:volcanicLakeUSVwLabels} is designed to take bathymetric measurements of such lakes and eliminate the need to endanger humans in the process.\cite{AWatanabe}

The USV is made specifically for the Mt. Zao Okama Crater Lake in Japan, where it replaces the need for a manned canoe to enter the volcanic lake situated in high
altitude, strong wind, and restricted area. The bathymetric measurements are used to indicate the amount of water, crater wall caving, and volcanic upthrusts in the lake.\cite{AWatanabe}

\section{Control Design}
The control design for a ASV is dependent on the type of task it is expected to preform. 
A basic functionality of a ASV is to follow a route. 
%This enables to ASV to arrive at a survey side and to preform measurements along a path.

A ASV designed to preform survey within a area, such as bathymetric measurements, require this functionally. 
Other survey tasks requires the ASV to hold it's position in a given GPS location while it's taking measurements. 
This would require a different type of controller than if it were expected to follow a path.

%one strength of an ASV is that it can map out an entire stream, whereas manual measurements typicaly will be cumbersome and low in mapping resolution due to accessibility of the stream and time constraints/cost.\\
%for marine survey it can be useful as it can enter narrower and more shallow waters than larger manned vessels would be able to.\\
%the military has also been using ASV's for surveillance.

In this project the focus is first and foremost the control design, which will be realized with focus on bathymetric measurements. This will constitute a basis for setting up requirements for precision which will determine important parameters in the control design.

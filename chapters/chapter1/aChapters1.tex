\chapter{Introduction}

Autonomous surface vehicles (ASV) has a range of applications such as environmental monitoring \cite[p. 745]{MAHsieh}, metrological data collection, marine biological research and surveillance \cite[p. 8-10]{FFahimi}.\\


An other application is bathymetric measurements \cite{MBibuli}. These measurements can be used for efficient and safe guidance of marine vessels. It is also interesting when studying biological oceanography where it i.a. can help in deciding which areas to protect for preservation of sea life \cite{NOService}.\\

%one strength of an ASV is that it can map out an entire stream, whereas manual measurements typicaly will be cumbersome and low in mapping resolution due to accessibility of the stream and time constraints/cost.\\
%for marine survey it can be useful as it can enter narrower and more shallow waters than larger manned vessels would be able to.\\
%the military has also been using ASV's for surveillance.



In this project the focus is first and foremost the control design, which will be realized with focus on bathymetric measurements. This will constitute a basis for setting up requirements for precision which will determine important parameters in the control design.

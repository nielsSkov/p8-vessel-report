\subsection{Controller Performance}
The performance of the controller can be tested as in the case of the linear quadratic regulator through simulation, and the result can be seen in \autoref{fig:xbdot_rob} and \ref{fig:yaw_rob}.

\autoref{fig:xbdot_rob} shows the step response of $\dot{x}_\mathrm{b}$, when a reference of 1 m s$^{-1}$ is set. In this case, the settling time is around \num{1.4} s and there is no overshoot.

The response in $\psi$, \autoref{fig:yaw_rob}, shows a settling time of \num{2.6} s and no overshoot.

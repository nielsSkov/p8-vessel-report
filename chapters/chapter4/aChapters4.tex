\chapter{Inner Controller Design}\label{chap:innercontrol}

The control system design is designed in different control levels, as explained in \autoref{chap:designaproach}. The inner controller receives reference signals in $\psi$ and $\dot{x}_\mathrm{b}$ and calculates the force the motors need to apply in order to track the given references. 

This part of the control system is solved with an LQR approach and $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ theory. The two approaches are then compared, checking their ability to reject disturbances and model uncertainties while tracking a step reference. The controller 'cost', which is calculated based on the state errors and usage of inputs, is also use as a comparative measure of the efficiency of the control approaches.

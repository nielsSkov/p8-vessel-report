The initial simulations indicated that the controllers preformed satisfactory in their respective design parameters. 
The LQR controller was shown to have faster step response than the robust controller, while the robust controller proved to be more robust towards noise and disturbances. 

However, the controller design proved to be an  issue when testing the system in real life. 
This indicates that there is some dynamics in the system that is not taken into account. 
The lack of a good motor description in the system model is suspected to introduce a significant delay in the system, which could influence the dynamics of the vessel . 
Additionally, the motors had a dead zone in the lower range of the operation area. 
This means the motors have a hard time preforming minor corrections, as these tend to require smaller motor values, thus limiting the precision of the corrections the vessel is able to preform.

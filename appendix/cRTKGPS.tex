\chapter{RTK GPS}\label{app:rtk_gps}
This appendix contains a description on how a RTK gps works, how the basestation is implemented and how to use it.


\section{Rtk gps basics}

An RTK GPS is often used for purposes where the precision of a ordinary GPS is insufficient.
It is able to archive a greater precision by comparing the measurements from the satellites with those of a base station.
The base station is a stationary GPS receiver with a known position, which streams correction data, to be used by the rover. 
The rover compares the data received from the base station, to it's own measurements and is through that able to receive a greater precision.
